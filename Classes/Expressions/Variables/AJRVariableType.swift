/**
 Tracks the type of a variable.
 
 For many uses, this is pretty much ignorable. We usually don't really care what "type" a variable is, as our language for parsing is basically type agnostic. However, at some point, we're going to want to present user interface to editing variables, and for that, we'll need types.
 
 Rather than implementing this as a enumeration, which might seem to most natural, we're going to so this as an object. That's for a number of reasons. One, we need to be able to extend types, especially in the interface layers, so that we can support editing. Two, as we go up the framework stack, we'll want to add more types. For example, the user interface layer will want to add support for rectangles, points, sizes, colors, and maybe fonts. Finally, three, and related to the previous, we'll want the types to be extensible via the plug-in mechanism, and for that we need a factory class and instances of objects.
 
 Note that the class does support AJRXMLCoding, but it isn't expected that the types will actually have data to encode/decode. They can, and there's nothing wrong with that, but mostly we'll just want to make sure we're instantiated the correct variable type when reading back from an archive. As such, subclasses should implement `public class ajr_nameForXMLArchiving`, and they should return something along the lines of `<my_type>Type`. For example, and integer type might return `integerType`.
