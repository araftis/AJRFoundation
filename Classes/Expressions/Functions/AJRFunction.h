 Registers a new class as a function. Note that the class should be a subclass of AJRFunction, and

 if it's already in use. In the case of two functions with the same name, the last one registered
 wins.

 Returns the name of the class. Normally, this method is here for use by the factory and implemented

 contain letters and numbers, and should begin with a letter.

 evaluation if does not have an expected number of arguments. Each argument may be a number, string,
 collection, or another expression, including another function to be evaluated.
