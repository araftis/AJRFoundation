 * @class AJRCmndArg

 * @discussion AJRCmndArg is used by AJRMain to hold all valid command line arguments that could
 * be passed on the command line. For most programs, these can automatically be used to
 * parse to command line for user parameters. If, for some reason, you need to do special
 * processing of the command line arguments, you can turn off the automatic feature.
 *
 * To create arguments for parsing, your application should call AJRMain's
 * registerArgument:parameter:type:selector:description:repeats: method repeatly for
 * each argument the user can place on the command line. Generally, these will be placed
 * within AJRMain's (or subclass') init method. Then, once the init method has returned,
 * the processArugments method will be called to determine and set all valid arguments.
 * if an invalid argument is called, the usage method will be called.
 *
 * By default, the usage message will print all valid arguments, a description of what they
 * should be and how they should be used, and then exits. You will have to override the
 * usage method in order to prevent the program exiting via a call to exit(1) if you do not
 * want the usage message to be fatal.

 * @class AJRMain
 *
 * @discussion AJRMain is an Objective C wrapper around the basic C main() routine which must be
 * present in all C programs. It is designed to make writting Objective-C programs that
 * work via the command line significantly easier. You will need to use Foundation Kit to
 * make use of AJRMain, as it tries to be as fully Foundation Kit compliant as is currently
 * possible.
 *
 * AJRMain will take care of most the things you need to worry about when writing a normal
 * C program, including command line arguments, argument parsing, messages and error
 * logging, as well as signal handling. It can also manage creating the main function on the
 * fly for you if you don't need to do anything special.
 *
 * Using AJRMain is fairly simple. You mostly just need to subclass the AJRMain object
 * and implement at least one method, run. This method will be called once everything has
 * been set up and is ready to run. Because C programs do not support event driven program
 * in any AppKit sense, all your actions must take place from within this method. This
 * method does not explicitly need to return, but if it does, the dealloc method will be called.
 * You could also end the program by calling the terminateWithExitCode: method, which will called C's
 * exit() function. This method depends on the C runtime system to clean up, which may
 * or may not meet your needs.
 *
 * Additionally, you can overload the init method which allows you to supply additional
 * initialization for your application. You init method should make sure to call [super init]
 * before it does it's own initialization. Note that init is called from within the initArgs:count:
 * method, which you should never overload, as it calls init for you. Generally speaking,
 * all you'll need to call from within init is the register... method to register the command line
 * arguments used by your program. Also, if you do not want to AJRMain to automatically
 * parse you arguments, you can also call setAutoprocessArguments: here.
 *
 * Finally, for you convenience for using NXStream's, AJRMain attachs stdin, stdout, and
 * stderr to AJRStrIn, AJRStdOut, and AJRStdErr, all NXStream's usable with the
 * standard NeXT streams library. Additionally, the functions AJRPrintf and AJRFPrintf
 * are defined and are equivalent to printf and fprintf. They are designed to work with
 * NXSteams and the Foundation Kit. NeXT's routines should be called for other I/O
 * processing.
