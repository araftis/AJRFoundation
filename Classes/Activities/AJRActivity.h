 @class AJRActivity
 @discussion Activies are used to monitor long running processing. Thus, if you're creating a background thread to do some task, then you probably want to consider using an activity to monitor the progress of the background thread.
 
 In some ways, an actvity is similar to a NSOperation, in that you can request an activity to stop, and hopefully your thread will poll the activity to see if it should cancel its current task, but unlike NSOperation, an activity is only a descriptive representation of what an operation is doing, while the NSOperation is controlling the actual operation itself (such as managing the NSRunLoop).
 
 To create an activity, simple call +(id)activity or +(id)init. You should then configure your activity, and once you've set all relevant information, such as a message, progress, etc... then you should call -(void)addToViewer. When you make this last call, if your environment is configured for a viewer, the activity will be added. This is generally the case with applications linked against ASInterface as well AJRFoundation. When your activity is complete, you should call -(void)removeFromViewer.
 
 Finally, in your background thread, you should make sure to call -(BOOL)isStopRequested. If this method returns YES, then you should abandon your current work, clean up, and exit your thread. While this is only advisory, it does produce a better user experience when the user can stop a long running task. Note that you don't necessarily have to abandon the task immediately. For example, you might change your message to something like "Cancelling operation... Waiting for remote service awknoledgment".

 @discussion Call this method if the activity is unable to display its progress in any meaningful way.

 @discussion Sets the current progress of the activity. This may or may be expressed as a percent. In fact, it's a value between progressMin and progressMax. This actually allows for nested activities where each activity is responsible for a different part of the progress. For example, you might have to make two or three calls to complete a request. As such, each of the subrequests could create an activity. When this happens, each subrequest would divide up the progress by setting progressMin and progressMax in a reasonable way for each task. For example, 0 to .25, .25 to .75, and .75 to 1.0.
