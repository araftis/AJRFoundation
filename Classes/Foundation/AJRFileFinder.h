 @class AJRFileFinder
 
 @abstract Search various standard file paths to location files and resources needed by a tool or application.
 
 @discussion This class allows you to search a set of standard directories, looking for a file, or a set of files. This is useful if you need to find a scattered list of files, or perhaps you need to find a particular configuration file.

 To find the files, the <CODE>AJRFileFinder</CODE> uses Apple's standard search order, by default. This order is to search Home, network, local, and finally sysmte. The class will search, also in order, the "Library", "Application Support", "Caches", and NSBundle.mainBundle resources. You can also easily add search of the user's home directory, the current directory, or the environment's PATH.
 
 Note that when some paths are search, the application automatically adds the <code>sharedFolderSubpath</code> to the path. This is done when the path is located in a "shared" space, for example, the library. For this reason, but default, rather than searching say "~/Library", AJRFileFinder would search "~/Library/<NSProcessInfo.processInfo.processName>". If you really don't want to search to include the process's name, you may set <code>sharedFolderSubpath</code> to <code>nil</code>.

 Using the class is fairly easy. In the easiest form, you can you <CODE>fileFinderForSubpath:andExtension:</CODE>. This allows you to search the default  directories for files in a given subpath with the given extension. A subpath is a path appended to the appropiate library path before the actual search is made. Here's an example that will search the library paths in a subdirectory called "Converters" looking for files with the extension ".bcvt":
 <PRE>
        files = [[AJRFileFinder filesFinderForSubpath:&#64;"Converters" andExtension:&#64;"bcvt"]];
 </PRE>
 This will return an NSArray of full path names of all files it found. This call, by default, will also not include duplicates.
 
 You can also search for header files by SDK. Note that the headers are always found in the current developer tools installation, as denoted by "xcode-select -p".  Header searches, by default, also include "/usr/include", "/usr/local/include", and "/opt/local/include".
 
 If you need more control over where and what files are search, you can create a finder with the more standard alloc and init calls. You can then customize the search parameters before executing the search.
