 Allows the receiver of the object to instantiate itself. This often isn't necessary, but some objects, like class clusters, may need to instantiate a specific subclass to work correctly. The default implementation of this method (hidden on NSObject) just calls [[self alloc] init]. While this is part of decoding, it's on the encoding side of the equation, because it's the object that's encoding which decides if it'll decode itself, or if it needs a placeholder object to do the decoding.

 This protocol requires that objects be instantiated in an "default" state.

The round-about-ness of this is required, because we might need to instantiate an object other than the one initially indicated by the archive.

 Called to decode the object. In this method to call various decode... method on coder passing in blocks to set the values as they're read from the XML stream. For this reason, you can't depend on specific values being set in any order, as the order they're called is the same as they're found in the XML. When XML decoding is complete, if you implement -[id<AJRXMLCoding> finalizeXMLDecoding], this method will be called. You can to any final initialization in this method, knowing that all of your setter blocks have been called.
 
 This method is optional, but it truth, it will need to be implemented by most objects. It's optional, because some decoders will make use of the +[id<AJRXMLCoding> instantiateWithXMLCoder:] and -[id<AJRXMLCoding> finalzeXMLDecoding] methods to actually perform the decoding on a place holder object that's then returned via the finalize method. For example, NSString cannot be modified after creation, but because we use a "lazy" initialization method, and because we don't want to return a "mutable" string, NSString decodes into a place holder that's then turned into an actual NSString in the finalize method.

 When implemented, this is called once all the decoding setter blocks have been called on the receiver. This method will normally just return self, but it may return a different object. This happens with some special objects, like NSString. Since NSStrings cannot be changed once created, when decoding, the NSString implementation of -[id<AJRXMLCoding> intantiateWithXMLCoder:] will return a place holder to do the decoding. Then, in the finalization, this method will return the actual string as read from the XML.
