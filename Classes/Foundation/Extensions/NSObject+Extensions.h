/*!
 This method attempts to copy an instance of an object into an instance of a subclass. This works  by using the NSCoding protocol, and as such, it may not work for all classes. If it does work,  the returned object will be of type subclass, but will contain the same instance variables as the  receiver. Not that the likelyhood is that the instance variables will also be copies of thier  original values.
 
 <p>Frankly, this method probably isn't safe to call except in highly unusual circumstances.
