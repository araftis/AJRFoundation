/*!
 This method attempts to copy an instance of an object into an instance of a subclass. This works  by using the NSCoding protocol, and as such, it may not work for all classes. If it does work,  the returned object will be of type subclass, but will contain the same instance variables as the  receiver. Not that the likelyhood is that the instance variables will also be copies of thier  original values.
 
 <p>Frankly, this method probably isn't safe to call except in highly unusual circumstances.

/*!
 This function is declared public, so that you can break on it in the event that you're encountering certain KVO issues. Specifically, this is designed to catch the situation where you're changing a value (you've called <pre>willChangeValueForKey:</pre>), and then you call willChangeValueForKey: before having called <pre>didChangeValueForKey:</pre>. When this happens you can get some strange behavior, especialy "spurious" exceptions from the KVO subsystem.
 
 To use this, do the following:
 
 <OL>
 <LI>In your runtime environent, create a new environment variable: <code>DebugKVO</code>.
 <LI>Set this value to [&lt;class_name&gt;:&lt;key&gt;]
 </OL>
 
 You can monitor more than one object by supplying multiple class/key pairs by separating multiple declarations by a semicolon. You should have no extranous white space. You can monitor all keys on a class by specifying the key <pre>ALL</pre>.
 
 NOTE: This will slow your code down, so you really only want to monitor classes and keys that are causing problems. The keys you need to monitor should be fairly obvious based off the exceptions thrown by Foundation. When you're no longer having issues, disable the environment variable, as this will disable installing this check.
 
 Actually calling this function will just log a warning to the console, but since you can't provide the correct parameters to the function, never call it directly.
