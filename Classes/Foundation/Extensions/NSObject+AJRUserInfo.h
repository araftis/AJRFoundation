 @abstract Basic method for adding custom user data to classes and objects.
 @discussion Generally speaking, these methods are just slightly nice covers for objc_getAssociatedObject() and objc_setAssociatedObject(), and exist mostly for historical reasons. That being said, they can be slightly more convenient to use, but at the cost of an additional NSString hash / dictionary lookup.

 Returns a given class object identified by key. Class objects are objects that have been assigned   to a class. In this respect they're similar to class objects in other object oriented languages, but  they do not need to be defined prior to use.
