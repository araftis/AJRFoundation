Some character will be composed of more than a single unicode UTF-16 character, which is why this method returns a count. So, if the character is say combining accent ` (U+0301) with a (U+0061), then character would be initialized with U+00E1, and the method would return 2.

 Note that if you need to loop over the string as all of it's UTF-32 character, you might find it better to use -[NSString dataUsingEncoding:NSUTFLittleEndian32StringEncoding], as it will be more efficient to convert the whole string in one go rather than repeatedly converting the string one character at a time, especially since strings are generally stored UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding, and therefore extra work must be done to convert to UTF-32.
